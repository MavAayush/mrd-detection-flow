# ðŸ§¬ MRD Detection in Flow Cytometry using VAE and GMM

This repository presents two complementary approaches for detecting **Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)** in flow cytometry data:

- [`VAE/`](./VAE/): Deep learning-based anomaly detection using **Variational Autoencoders**
- [`GMM/`](./GMM/): Probabilistic modeling with **Gaussian Mixture Models**

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

We work with flow cytometry data collected from **12 patients**:

- **Healthy Patients (P1â€“P6)**:
  - ~27 million cells
  - Used for model training
- **Unhealthy Patients (P7â€“P12)**:
  - ~20 million cells
  - Used for evaluation and MRD prediction

Each cell is represented by **14 features**. The models are trained to learn the healthy distribution and detect anomalous cells in new patient data, which may indicate MRD.

---

## Objective

To accurately identify cells that are anomalous (i.e., likely cancerous) using only **unsupervised learning** methods trained on healthy patient data. These anomalies collectively form an estimate of MRD (%).

## Methods Used

### 1. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

- Learns latent representations via probabilistic encoding/decoding
- Detects anomalies based on **reconstruction error (MSE)**
- Explored different latent dimensions (2 and 4) and Î² values
- Uses **Leave-One-Patient-Out (LOPO)** validation with **progressive fine-tuning**
- Produces per-cell MSE scores â†’ used to estimate MRD

### 2. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

- Trains a mixture of Gaussians on healthy cell data
- Evaluates likelihood of each new cell under the model
- Low-likelihood cells are flagged as anomalies
- Tried multiple component counts (4, 6, 16)
- Compared `full` vs `tied` covariance structures
- Final threshold: **1.5th percentile of healthy scores**

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between predicted and actual MRD %
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **MRD Estimation** for each patient based on anomaly scores

Both models approximate expert-annotated MRD scores with high accuracy.
