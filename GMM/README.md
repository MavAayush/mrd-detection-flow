# Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for Novelty Detection

This module implements a probabilistic clustering-based approach to detect Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in flow cytometry data using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

## Purpose

GMM assumes that our data is composed of several clusters, each following a multivariate Gaussian distribution (bell curve) in 14-dimensional space (as our data as 14 cell features). We:
- **Train GMM only on healthy patient data (P1 to P6)** to learn how normal cells are distributed.
- Model the data as a mixture of Gaussians, each with its own:
  - **Mean vector** (center of the blob)
  - **Covariance matrix** (shape and spread)
  - **Weight** (relative importance of the blob)

Once trained, we feed test data (unhealthy patients P7 to P12) and:

- **Score each cell's log-likelihood** under the model.
- If the score is below a certain threshold (based on healthy cells), it's flagged as an anomaly.

## Approach

- Due to the large dataset size (~27 million healthy cells), we tried:
  - **Downsampling to 100k** cells for faster fitting
  - **Intermediate sampling (1M, 20M)**
  - **Full dataset fitting** for final models
- Used BIC and WCSS to choose the optimal number of components (`n_components`)
- Tried different values for `n_components` such as **4, 6, and 16** to evaluate model granularity
  - `k=4` was chosen based on WCSS as it provided a balance between underfitting and overfitting
- Covariance type was set to **`full`**, allowing each component to have its own general covariance matrix.
- Scaled features with **StandardScaler**
- Trained GMM using **EM (Expectation-Maximization)**
- Used **1st percentile of healthy log-likelihood scores** as the anomaly threshold
- Scored both healthy and unhealthy patients and computed per-patient MRD %

## ðŸ“ƒ GMM Records

The trained GMM stores:

- Means (centers) of each Gaussian blob
- Covariance matrices (spread/shape)
- Weight of each Gaussian component
- Cluster membership probabilities for each point
- Log-likelihood scores for novelty detection

---

## ðŸ“ˆ GMM Outputs

- Log-likelihood scores for each cell (healthy & unhealthy)
- Anomaly classification based on threshold
- % of anomalous cells per patient

**MRD Prediction Results for Unhealthy (Patients 7-12):**

| Patient |  **Actual MRD (%)** | **Predicted MRD (%)** |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| P7      |    3.28 %           |    4.99               |
| P8      |    1.20 %           |    1.55               |
| P9      |    9.30 %           |    9.90               |
| P10      |    2.17 %           |    3.86               |
| P11     |    14.60 %           |    11.77               |
| P12     |    4.20 %           |    4.66               |

## Visualization

We used: 
- **Bar charts** for comparing actual vs predicted MRD
- **Line charts** for trend analysis across patients

---

## Notes

- Multiple trials were conducted with different values of `n_components`
- Experiments included fitting on full vs sampled datasets
- Anomalies in healthy patients are low (as expected), validating model performance
